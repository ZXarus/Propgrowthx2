The system supports two primary users: Owner and Tenant, with Manager as an optional role.
The Owner logs in using email and password with JWT-based authentication.
After successful login, the system checks whether the Owner has any properties.
If properties exist, the Owner is redirected to the Dashboard; otherwise, the Owner is redirected to the Onboarding page to add the first property.
